- fix oauthproxy 500 on login
- fix grafana login


- start moving services from my other servers to this cluster
- set up grafana dashboards


- Services
    - Personal Website


also i just noticed that the services that are using oauth proxy arent accessible since oauth proxy runs into "500 Internal Server Error" when trying to login and access any of the pages behind it
